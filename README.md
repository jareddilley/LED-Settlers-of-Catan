Fully 3D printed 2-4 person Catan board with corresponding LED tiles, electronic rolling with place pointers, recourse summary display, and all in a bettery powered sealed package 

Built with the Open Source mindset allowing other people to build it at home with an 3D printer (I used a Ender 3 Pro) with a choice of soldier or using a breadboard 

Attached is the Fusion 360 so the models can be editted directly and used to better understand how it is brocken down. A youtube link for visual learners:

Wiring for a breadboard which can be transerfered to perfboard to fit in the center houring on the model above:

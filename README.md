Fully 3D printed 2-4 person Catan board with corresponding LED tiles, electronic rolling with place pointers, recourse summary display, and all in a battery-powered sealed package. This project is powered by a rechargeable 9V battery and an Arduino micro to minimize its footprint. Above is a demo of the rolling animation that is done at the touch of a button. When clicked a random number generator is used to roll the dice with the same probability of rolling numbers that two regular dice do. Once rolled the number will be displayed on the seven-segment display and the corresponding locations will be singled out and lit up. This fixes one of the common issues of Catan where you roll the dice and try to figure out who gets what.

Built with the Open Source mindset allowing other people to build it at home with a 3D printer (I used an Ender 3 Pro) with a choice of soldier or using a breadboard. 

Attached is the Fusion 360 so the models can be edited directly and used to better understand how it is broken down. A YouTube link for visual learners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJuYirOUeOg&t=12s&ab_channel=JaredDilley

The light-up hexagons make a game night in the dark that much cooler.
